# Calculation Engine

A simple graph-based calculation model with a fluent builder interface that can compile into a C# delegate.

This is an attempt to swap from an imperative calculation engine to a declarative one, with support for evaluation, compilation and explanation.

## Things to clean-up:

* Add some more node types, explore different types of calculations and permit different result types per tree
